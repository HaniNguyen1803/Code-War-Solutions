# Problem: Count the Monkeys!

# Instruction:
# You take your son to the forest to see the monkeys. You know that there are a certain number there (n), but your son is too young
# to just appreciate the full number, he has to start counting them from 1.
# As a good parent, you will sit and count with him. Given the number (n), populate an array with all numbers up to and including 
# that number, but excluding zero.

#Solution:
def monkey_count(n):
    countrange = list(range(n))
    count=[]
    for index,ele in enumerate(countrange):
        ele = ele + 1
        count.append(ele)
    return count
